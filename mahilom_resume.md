### :dart: Objective
- My goal in ICT is to learn the basic skills that will help me in my studies and future work. I want to know how to use computers, the internet, and different applications correctly. I also want to improve my communication, research, and problem-solving skills using technology. By starting with small steps, I can build my knowledge and later explore more advanced skills in ICT. My simple goal is to become confident in using ICT in my everyday life.
